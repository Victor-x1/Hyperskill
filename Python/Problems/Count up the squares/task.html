  <p>Write a program that reads from the console integers (one in a line) until <strong>their</strong> <strong>sum</strong> is equal to <strong>0</strong>. Immediately after that, it should display <strong>the sum of the squares</strong> of all the entered numbers.</p> 
  <p>It is guaranteed that at some point the sum of the entered numbers will be equal to 0. After that, reading is <strong>not necessary</strong> to continue.</p> 
  <p>In case the first integer equals to 0, just print out 0 instead of the sum of the squares.</p> 
  <p>For example, we are reading the numbers <samp>1, -3, 5, -6, -10, 13.</samp> At this point, we have noticed that the sum of these numbers is 0 and output the sum of their squares, not paying attention to the fact that there are still unread values.</p>
